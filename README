Makefile-Parallel

The module Makefile::Parallel implements a way of describing process
inter-dependency with a textual specification resembling the Makefile syntax,
and provides a scheduler with many fancy options of running the
specification on a number of sub-systems.

Currently, a "local" and a "PBS" (ROCKS clusters) sub-systems are
implemented and full operational. However, creating new sub-systems
is as simple as implementing a well defined interface.

This work is already being used at production, but a lot of more features
are planned to be added. Sorry for the lack of documentation and tests
for now, this is something that will be better in the future.

For documentation, please read the pmake POD (you can found it on
examples/ of this distribution).

Please report any problem or suggestion to
